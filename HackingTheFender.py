# Hacking the Fender Project Description

# The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret
# passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to
# The Fenderâ€˜s systems, you must update his "passwords.csv" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to
# do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by
# The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

# Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for
# justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.


# Import the CSV and JSON modules

import json

# Create list of users who's passwords have been compromised

# Open 'passwords' CSV file. Pass 'password_file' object holder to CSV reader for parsing. Save each row to temp var
# and add each username to compromised users list

    password_csv = csv.DictReader(password_file)
