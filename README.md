Project-Portfolio contains a several projects I have created from either courses at IU Indianapolis, online courses such as CodeCademy, or any other indepenedent project I have worked on.
This portfolio is rather new and projects will continually be added moving forward.
Note that this does not contain all projects I have worked on, but am actively working on growing this portfolio as I've learned to work with Git and GitHub.

Unless specified in the project file, projects were worked on individually.
Group projects will mention which sections were written by me.
